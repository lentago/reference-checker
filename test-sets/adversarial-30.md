# Adversarial Test Set — 30 References

This reference list is deliberately constructed to test the Forensic Reference-Integrity Auditor against layered fabrication techniques. It contains a mix of clean references, manipulated references, and fully fabricated references designed to probe each forensic heuristic.

**DO NOT use this reference list in any real manuscript.** It contains fabricated citations.

## Trap Index

This index is the answer key. It should NOT be provided to the auditor during testing — the auditor should detect these independently.

| Ref # | Trap Type | Expected Detection |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Clean | Defensible |
| 2 | Clean | Defensible |
| 3 | Homoglyph (Cyrillic `а` in journal title) | Elevated or High |
| 4 | Clean | Defensible |
| 5 | Shadow paper (fully fabricated, plausible metadata) | High |
| 6 | Digit-swap (volume transposed) | Moderate or Elevated |
| 7 | Clean | Defensible |
| 8 | Author-shifting (author added) | Elevated |
| 9 | Clean [a] | Defensible |
| 10 | Clean | Defensible |
| 11 | Journal mutation (word substituted in journal title) | Elevated or High |
| 12 | Clean | Defensible |
| 13 | Shadow paper (fabricated, uses real author names) | High |
| 14 | Clean | Defensible |
| 15 | Homoglyph (Cyrillic `о` in author name) | Elevated or High |
| 16 | Author-shifting (author removed) | Elevated |
| 17 | Author-shifting (Noori Hekmat S added; author order differs from Crossref record) | Elevated (H4) |
| 18 | Pop-culture junk (Obi-Wan Kenobi) | High |
| 19 | Clean [a] | Defensible |
| 20 | Clean | Defensible |
| 21 | Digit-swap (page numbers transposed) | Moderate or Elevated |
| 22 | Shadow paper (fabricated, plausible title) | High |
| 23 | Clean | Defensible |
| 24 | Journal mutation (qualifier added to journal title) | Elevated or High |
| 25 | Clean (grey literature — government report) | Defensible |
| 26 | Author-shifting (authors reordered) | Moderate or Elevated |
| 27 | Clean [b] | Defensible |
| 28 | Double-Real trap (DOI resolves to Bann et al. 2025, Integration of Peer Navigators — a different real paper) | High |
| 29 | Clean (grey literature — organizational guideline) | Defensible |
| 30 | Composite: homoglyph + digit-swap + author-shift + Double-Real layer (DOI resolves to ACNM/MANA/NACPM consensus statement — a different real paper) | High |

**Expected distribution:** 14 Clean/Defensible, 16 manipulated or fabricated (High/Elevated/Moderate)

> [a] DOIs for refs 9 and 19 resolve via the Crossref API to exactly the papers cited (Sandall et al. 2016, CD004667.pub5; Begley et al. 2015, CD007412.pub4 respectively). H5 cannot fire when Crossref metadata matches the citation — this is a genuine detection ceiling, not a test-set trap. Both entries were originally mislabeled as Double-Real traps; corrected per issue #37 (2026-06-19).
>
> [b] DOI 10.1016/j.jogn.2018.07.002 has been retired and reassigned in the JOGNN system; Crossref now maps it to a different AWHONN position statement (pages 722–723 rather than the cited 724–726). A conservative Moderate flag from the auditor is expected behavior given the live DOI-to-record mismatch and is not a true misfire.
